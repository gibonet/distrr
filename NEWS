* new CRAN submission.  
* new function: dcc6_fixed(). Same as dcc6() but with the 
  possibility to choose a variable for which the total will not
  be estimated (argument fixed_variable)
* data "invented_wages" has been recreated with tibble::new_tibble().
  Now invented_wages has class "tbl_df" "tbl" "data.frame", while
  before it had class "tbl_df" "data.frame". This should fix 
  issue #1.
* dplyr::combine() (deprecated) has been replaced with 
  base::unlist(..., recursive = FALSE) in internal functions (not exported) 
  joint_all_() and joint_all_funs_().

distrr 0.0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------

* lazyeval has been substituted with rlang (tidy evaluation).
  This means that all the softly-deprecated dplyr functions that
  ended with an underscore (like summarise_(), select_(), ...) have
  been substituted with the versions without underscore (like
  summarise(), select(), and so on). All the dplyr functions are
  in dplyr_new_wrappers.R.
* In some functions (jointfun_(), dcc6() and joint_all_funs_())
  n() has been replaced with dplyr::n() (to be compatible with
  dplyr 0.0.8).
